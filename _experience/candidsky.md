<a href="http://www.candidsky.co.uk">Candidsky</a> is a digital agency based in central Manchester. I began my role as a frontend developer there in February 2014.

I was originally in a team of 7, this grew to eventually be a team of up to 15. My main responsibility was to build and maintain websites, focusing on the frontend and closely working with 2 backend developers and a frontend developer / designer. I would work with the designer to implement his designs in to websites and often this would include us both having input on the development and design.

I also worked with other members of the team on site maintenance, SEO, CRO and project management (Scrum). As my time at the agency went on, my responsibilities increased to include more backend and design work, attending client meetings, interacting with clients over the phone, and leading projects.

In this role I once again was able to considerably improve my skills, both in regards to the web and more generally in areas such as time management, scheduling and interacting with clients. I got the opportunity to work on some large projects and to also take lead some projects of my own. I worked frequently to tight deadlines under pressure but also enjoyed and contributed to a great office atmosphere.
