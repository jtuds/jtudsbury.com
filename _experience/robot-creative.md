<a href="http://www.robot-creative.co.uk">Robot Creative</a> is a full service agency based in Altrincham, Cheshire. In early 2012 I was brought in on a freelance basis, originally for a few weeks, this was extended to around 3 months until finally I was offered a permanent role as a developer.

Working with the head of digital, another developer, a designer and two other team members my main responsibility was to work with the designer and use his designs to build websites. These sites were most commonly for small to medium sized businesses and were both brochure/lead generation and ecommerce sites.

I was also responsible for site maintenance, updates, building emails for email marketing, and attending client meetings.

In this role I got to experience what it was like to work in a digital agency, which was my aim since university. My web skills improved considerably during this period along with my general ability to work within a digital team, gathering a better understanding of everything from time management to teamwork.
