After graduating from University in summer 2011 I was given the chance to work with the Salford University digital team on a temporary basis in order to help them prepare for the launch of a completely overhauled Salford University website.

I was responsible for a range of tasks, such as editing HTML templates, updating copy via the custom CMS (<a href="https://www.squiz.net/technology/cms">Squiz Matrix</a>) and editing XML files to prepare them for importing. Overall, my role was to assist in whatever way possible to get the website ready for a deadline.

With around 15 people in the team and a deadline to work to I got an opportunity to experience what it was like to work in a real life digital team and to work under pressure from stakeholders. The role was originally planned to last 4 weeks, however after a weeks break I was asked back to help out again for a week, which demonstrates my value to the team at the time.

The <a href="http://www.salford.ac.uk/ug-courses/accounting-and-finance">courses pages</a> of the website remain as they were when they were launched in 2011.
