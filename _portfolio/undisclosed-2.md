Developed and designed at <a href="https://candidsky.com">Candidsky</a>.

This website is still in the build phase and is not finalised therefore I cannot reveal too much about any of the project in order to avoid undermining any marketing efforts or providing any opportunities to competitors.

<strong>Note:</strong> So as to not reveal any branding I have changed the colour scheme in any screenshots, hence the awful grey and yellow.
